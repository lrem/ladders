    <em>Ladders</em> is a free service that allows you to track your own custom
    leagues.
    It uses the patented 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">Microsoft® TrueSkill™</a>
    algorithm to compute
    a reliable ranking assigning a single skill number to each of the players.
    It is somewhat similar to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo</a>,
    the rating system widely used in chess and similar games,
    except here you can have games with any number of teams and players.
