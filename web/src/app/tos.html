<h1>Terms of Service/Privacy Policy</h1>
<p> Effective since: 2017-06-17.</p>
<p>
    The Service, available at http://ladders.lrem.net/, 
    is provided free of charge, as-is, without any guarantees or obligations
    to the extent permitted by the law of Republic of Ireland.
    In particular, no guarantees are given about continued availability,
    data retention, reliability, correctness or fitness for any purpose.
</p>
<p>
    No account creation, nor signing in,
    is required for regular use of the service.
    No cookies nor similar techniques are used in this case.
    Signing in via a third party (e.g. Google) is needed to create
    and later establish ownership of a ladder
    (a separate part of the service dedicated to tracking a single league).
    In such a case, the service only stores the numeric user id provided
    and explicitly <em>does not store e-mail address nor user name</em>.
    This user id will not be purposefully shared with any third party.
</p>
<p>
    In course of using the service, users describe matches between players.
    No attempt is made towards verifying the veracity of such descriptions.
    A ranking is calculated based on the descriptions.
    Both the descriptions and the calculated ranking are then provided
    to any user of the service.
    They can be selectively removed, without prior notice nor stated reason,
    at any point either by the ladder's owner (creator),
    or the service operator.
</p>
<p>
    The service operator reserves the right to remove and block inappropriate
    content, at any point and without prior notice nor stated reason.
    The service operator reserves the right to block abusive users,
    at any point and without prior notice nor stated reason.
</p>
<p>
    The service operator collects operational logs,
    that include some identifying data of all traffic,
    including the IP address and user agent string
    (usually describing browser and operating system).
    Users might also be directed to third party services for the purposes
    of analytics and/or advertising.
    The third parties may use cookies or similar techniques.
</p>
<p>
    The service operator reserves the right to change these terms,
    at any point and with a 30 day prior notice displayed in the service.
